# Zania QA Backend

This repository contains a backend service for document-based question answering, built using **FastAPI**, **LangChain**, and **OpenAI**.  
It allows you to upload a PDF document and a JSON file with questions, and returns concise, context-aware answers drawn directly from the document.

---

## Overview

The service extracts text from a PDF, splits it into chunks, embeds those chunks into a **FAISS vector index**, and uses a **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** pipeline to generate factual answers with OpenAI models.  
Itâ€™s designed to be simple, portable, and production-ready, with a clean FastAPI interface and full Docker support.

### Key Features
- Upload a **PDF** and a **JSON file** of questions.
- Uses **FAISS** for efficient similarity search.
- Retrieval and answer generation handled by **LangChain + OpenAI**.
- Simple, configurable environment setup.
- Ready for deployment via **Docker**.
- Includes unit tests (pytest).
